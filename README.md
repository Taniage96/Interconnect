# Interconnect Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

The telecommunications operator Interconnect wants to be able to forecast their customer churn rate. If a user is found to be planning to leave, they will be offered promotional codes and special plan options. Interconnect's marketing team has collected some of their customers' personal data, including information about their plans and contracts, to achieve this goal.

### Interconnect Services

Interconnect primarily provides two types of services:

1.  Fixed-line phone communication. The phone can be connected to multiple lines simultaneously.
2.  Internet. The network can be set up via a phone line (DSL, *digital subscriber line*) or via a fiber optic cable.

Some other services the company offers include:

* Internet security: antivirus software (*DeviceProtection*) and a malicious website blocker (*OnlineSecurity*).
* A technical support line (*TechSupport*).
* Cloud file storage and data backup (*OnlineBackup*).
* TV streaming (*StreamingTV*) and a movie catalog (*StreamingMovies*).

Customers can choose between a monthly payment or sign a 1 or 2-year contract. They can use various payment methods and receive an electronic invoice after a transaction.
